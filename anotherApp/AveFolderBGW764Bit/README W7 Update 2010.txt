Added Registry Entries to Ave's patch the application to work with Windows 7.
Still integrates into the Folders Customize this Folder Right-Click Menu Option
Enables Extended Tiles to Folders except My Computer and Users Documents*
*Keep Tile in My Computer and Users Documents allows user to still view Drives with Capacity Progressbar under Drives


All functions in Ave's still work the same

Side Effect of Ave's in Windows 7:
If you remove a background and have Shadows selected it will leave traces of images behind items in a folder
Workaround for this is to just make sure you unselect Shadow if you remove the background






Found registry fix by pure accident from Winhelponline from tutorial by Ramesh Srinivasan
